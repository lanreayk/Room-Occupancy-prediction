# Room-Occupancy-prediction
## Introduction
This is a project to determine if an hotel room is vacant or occupied using  room physical variables/feastures (historical data) such as Temperature, Humidity, CO2 and Light. The project would be useful in fraud detection often papetrated by Hotel managers or receptionist where they present wrong number of empty rooms to make money. it can also be used to know if a client has checked out or not from a room. 
## Problem Statement
The problem statement was to come up with a solution for an Hotel management to solve the problem where hotel workers manipulate number of empty rooms to make cheap financial gains. I suggested that if some data suchas the ones given above are avaialble it might be possible to know if a room was actually empty or occupied at a particular time.
